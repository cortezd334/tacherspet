# Teacher's Pet

## Description

Going virtual hasn't been easy for teachers and students since the pandemic hit. Although we have become more familiar with classes on Zoom, teachers are having a difficult time customizing their lessons to cater to their students. We created a fully customizable flashcard creation and display too. With this tool, teachers can easily create flashcards and use them for virtual activities to engage with students.

## What it does

Teacher's Pet gives teachers the power to create customized flashcard activities and a fun way to interact with their students through flashcard activities. The website stores lessons (decks of cards), information on the cards, and student information. It also allows teachers to display their cards in a grid style or single card to present to students. The presentation features the queue of students and a timer. Teachers can decide to show or hide either of the features to give their students the best experience.

## How we built it

We designed the prototype for Teacherâ€™s Pet using Figma. We built the front-end using React/Redux and built the back-end using Ruby on Rails. We created and displayed data through Microsoft Azure mySQL database.
